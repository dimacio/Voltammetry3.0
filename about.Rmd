The following digital tools were used to develop this site:

* [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/): `R` is a software language and programming environment for statistical computing and for the graphical analysis of data. It is available for use as "Free Software"" under the terms of the Free Software Foundationâ€™s GNU General Public License.
* [`Rmarkdown`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html): `Rmarkdown` is a package for `R` that combines simple `markdown` authoring tools for formatting text with chunks of `R` code; when compiled using [`knitr`](http://yihui.name/knitr/) the resulting output is a formatted docuement that contains the results of executing the embedded `R` code. Although `Rmarkdown` can produce files in a variety of formats, the two of particular interest in this project are `html` and `pdf` formats. 
* [`RStudio`](https://www.rstudio.com/home/): `RStudio` is an integrated development environment that, among other features, provides a console for running `R`, a window for editing files, a window for managing files, a window for viewing plots, a window for viewing help files, and an interal browser window of viewing dynamic content. `RStudio` also provides tools for automating many tasks. Although `RStudio` is a convenient way to manage this project, it is not a requirement as it simply provides a way to work with `R` and `Rmarkdown`.
* `R Packages`: One of the strengths of `R` is the availablity of packages of `R` functions that are designed to work with data. The materials in this project, for example, use the [`plotly`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/index.html) package to create interactive graphics, the [`DT`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT/index.html) and the [`magrittr`](cran magrittr) packages to create interactive data tables, and the [`animation`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/animation/index.html) package to create video animations.

This website consists of a set of `.Rmd` files created using `Rmarkdown` and two `.R` script files that contain functions written to simulate, plot, and extract data from cyclic voltammetry experiments (`cvFunctions.R`) and to draw redox ladder diagrams (`ladder_pot.R`). The `.Rmd` files were converted into a website---whose structure is defined by a user-written `_site.yml` file---using the command

```
rmarkdown::render_site()
```

As a student work through the material, s/he can edit any of the `.Rmd` files by adding text and chunks of `R` code, perhaps to answer a problem, to annotate existing text with comments, to make lists of questions to explore; and s/he also can create new `.Rmd` files and add them to the `_site.yml` file. Rendering any pre-existing `.Rmd` file using the command

```
rmarkdown::render_site("file.name")
```

will update its `.html` file. When adding a new `.Rmd` file, it is neccessary to add it to the `_site.yml` file and to re-render the full site by using the command

```
rmarkdown::render_site()
```
